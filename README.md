# Hey Everyone!

My name is Kevin and I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying Statistics and Data Science. I love working with numbers and love math a lot!

I have an interest in statistical modeling and applying statistics to better the world (and trading strategies). Feel free to reach out!
