# Hello :)

Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley. 

- 📖 I'm studying Statistics and Data Science, and will graduate May 2027.
- 🏠 My hometown is Anaheim, CA. Ask me food recs!
- 📤 Connect with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinhoatruong/">here!</a>
- 😁 I enjoy collecting stationary, going to concerts, and volunteering at my local bunny shelter!

I love working with numbers and love math a lot! I have an interest in statistical modeling and applying statistics to better the world (and trading strategies). Feel free to reach out!
